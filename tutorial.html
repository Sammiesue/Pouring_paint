                <h4>Tutorial</h4>
                <h5>Materials:</h5> 
                    <p>1. Acrylic art of various colors 
                    2. A canvas 
                    3. Pouring Medium (clear liquid glue, Liquitex, water, etc.)
                    4. (Optional) Resist Additive (rubbing alcohol, silicone, dish soap, etc.)
                    5. Cups (plastic washable preferably)
                    6. A Blowdryer or Straw
                    7. A Container of some kind
                    8. (Optional) Gloves
                    9. Pallet Knives
                    10. Stirring Sticks</p>
                <h5>Setting Up:</h5>
                    <p>This is quite a messy form of art. But that's the fun of it! I use one of those tin foil pans to keep all my paint and mess contained, but anything with sides to prevent the paint from getting everywhere will do.</p>
                    <p>To begin the process, put different colors of paint into each cup. Add the pouring medium until the consistency is similar to that of runny pancake batter.
                        The thinner the paint is, the more it will spread. But if it is too thin, then the paint will simply be like water paints and not show up much. If the paint is too thick, it won't spread at all.</p>
                <h5>Pouring the Paint:</h5>
                    <p>Once you have your paints in the cups and the pouring medium added (examples listed above), there are many differnt techniques of doing this. Techniques include: the dirty pour, the flip cup, thr tree-ring pour, the dutch pour, and the dip pour. Check out how to do the different techniques at the top on the Techniques link.</p>

                <h5>Drying:</h5>
                    <p>After you have done your desired technique, it is time to dry. Put your painting in a safe, room temperature environment with nothing around that could fall on it or mess it up. Believe me, this has happened to me and it is not fun. Once your painting is dry, you can keep it as decoration, a collection, or you could give it away to a freind, family member, or a charity. 
                        I personally like to add Bible verses on mine and gift and sell them at birthdays and events. Thanks for checking out my page! To see some of the work that I've done, go to the My Art link at the top to check them out :).</p>
